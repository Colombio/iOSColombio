For more information about Colombio, or if you need support, please contact us at &lt;a href=\"io.colomb://support_mail\"&gt;support@colomb.io&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;What is Colombio?&lt;/h2&gt;Colombio is a free communication channel aimed to news media companies and journalists, through which you can send story tips, photo and video directly to your favourite news media e-mail, without knowing the contact.\n&lt;h2&gt;When to use Colombio?&lt;/h2&gt;Use Colombio whenever you think you have something important for the public to be informed, and with the help of journalist. You can make an impact on your community by participating in news production, whether it’s about breaking news, or some problems in the community, good things or people that should be publicly rewarded, etc. News media companies can rate you or reward you with real money for your contribution, or if they want to buy your photo or video.\n&lt;h2&gt;Why do I have to register?&lt;/h2&gt;Registration ensures that the money you earn through Colombio stays secure. The registration information is used only for managing Colombio service and it is never transferred to third parties or media.\n&lt;h2&gt;How to send news with Colombio?&lt;/h2&gt;You can send the news in 4 simple steps:&lt;br/&gt;\t\t1. On the Home screen choose button for topic or direct photo/video recording&lt;br/&gt;\t\t2. On the Upload screen fill in Title &amp; Description (mandatory), upload picture or video and select tag (optional). We recommend tags because media can find your news more quickly. Swipe to the next screen.&lt;br/&gt;\t\t3. On the Select media screen select one or more of your favourite media and swipe.&lt;br/&gt;\t\t4. Choose one of the sending options and click Send button\nApp will send the news and put it on your timeline. If media buy or publish your news you will be notified on the timeline.\nYou can also see all these steps in &lt;a href=\"io.colomb://reset_tutorial\"&gt;Tutorial&lt;/a&gt; screens.\n&lt;h2&gt;Who can see the information I sent?&lt;/h2&gt;Information which is sent can be only viewed by those you sent them to and it’s not public. Everything you have sent can be found in Colombio mobile app on &lt;a href=\"io.colomb://open_timeline\"&gt;Timeline&lt;/a&gt; screen. If the message is inappropriate we will not receive it and news media will not see it.\n&lt;h2&gt;Can I be contacted by journalists?&lt;/h2&gt;Yes, we created a messaging system, through which news media or their journalist can communicate directly with you for more information. The communication is private and seen only by you and the news media.\n&lt;h2&gt;How does privacy work?&lt;/h2&gt;It is recommended that you identify yourself when selling news, photos or videos or your own texts and managing payments. It increases your credibility. If you want to be credited or contacted after sending the news, photos or videos, select these options, so the media can contact you.\n&lt;h2&gt;Sending as Anonymous&lt;/h2&gt;You can also send information as Anonymous, and be registered at the same time. This option makes sure you are anonymous and the media doesn\'t have or get any of your private data. News media receive the message from \"Anonymous user\", and can’t access your private data in any way.\n&lt;h2&gt;Who owns the rights to the news I send to Colombio?&lt;/h2&gt;When you send news to Colombio, you provide Colombio with rights of use in the Colombio service. All news can be transferred to media and must not be published without appropriate rights and permissions.\n&lt;h2&gt;Can I submit news, photos or video from others?&lt;/h2&gt;No. You must own all rights to news, photos or video sent to Colombio. Sending downloaded news, photos or video may result in you being banned from the system and subject of lawsuit.\n&lt;h2&gt;Can my name be published with the news?&lt;/h2&gt;You can be credited for your news if you choose this option. This privacy configuration is on the Send screen and in the Colombio mobile app settings (&lt;a href=\"io.colomb://open_myprofile\"&gt;My Profile&lt;/a&gt; screen).\n&lt;h2&gt;How does awarding work?&lt;/h2&gt;News media companies can pay you for your contribution, for any information sent, if they choose to. They might see you as a valuable source in the future, and make commitment to you in this way.\n&lt;h2&gt;How does selling work?&lt;/h2&gt;You can offer to sell your photo or video to one or multiple news media companies at the same time. Activate \"I want to sell\" option on the sending screen and name your price. News media companies can accept, reject or send you an offer on how much they are willing to pay for copyrights for your photo/video. If they offer back, you can accept, or reject.\n&lt;h2&gt;Is the content I want to sell secure?&lt;/h2&gt;Until the content is bought from news media company, it can be downloaded and the picture or video is watermarked. It can’t be used by any news media for publishing. By selling photo/video, you give away copyrights to publish or sell the photo again. You always remain the author of the photo/video, but they become the buyer’s property.\n&lt;h2&gt;How do I earn money with Colombio?&lt;/h2&gt;You earn money with every information or content that is purchased or rewarded. When you submit content, it becomes available for publishing. Content submitted on Colombio is instantly available to Colombio media partners around the world. This content can be used by the media and it can be bought or rewarded if the media find it appropriate. Colombio does not resell your news or content – we are a service provider between you as the owner of rights and the news media companies as potential buyers.\n&lt;h2&gt;What is news task?&lt;/h2&gt;News media companies can order services from you. The fee for this task depends on the media decision and it is always paid if the media use your content. Whenever your content is purchased or rewarded, you receive a notification directly on your smartphone. However, some content may not sell. Submitting information quickly and in the right place increases the possibility of your news being purchased.\n&lt;h2&gt;How can I cash out my earnings?&lt;/h2&gt;Compensation for sold content is paid to your Colombio account, visible in the Colombio mobile app (&lt;a href=\"io.colomb://open_myprofile\"&gt;My Profile&lt;/a&gt; balance). You can transfer money to your PayPal account by tapping Cash Out.

For details on this topic consider contacting your local tax authorities.\n&lt;h2&gt;Who to contact if I have a technical problem or support issue I need resolved?&lt;/h2&gt;The best way to get in touch with us is to contact us at &lt;a href=\"io.colomb://support_mail\"&gt;support@colomb.io&lt;/a&gt;";
